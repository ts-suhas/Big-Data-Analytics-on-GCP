Big Data Analytics on GCP
🚀 Big Data Analytics on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 🌍

I recently completed a project focused on Big Data strategy and analytics using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to process and analyze large datasets. The project involved:

🔹 Big Data Strategy: Proposed GCP services for scalable infrastructure, including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and BigQuery to handle data efficiently.

🔹 Data Preprocessing: Utilized Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine for cleaning, transforming, and refining datasets. Tasks included text replacements, typo corrections, and data transformation.

🔹 Data Analysis: Leveraged BigQuery to derive insights, such as identifying top states with the highest customer count and postal codes with maximum sales.

🔹 Visualization: Used Google Looker Studio to create data-driven reports for actionable insights.

🔹 Security & Access Control: Integrated IAM and KMS for role-based access and encryption.

This project strengthened my expertise in GCP, BigQuery, Data Processing, and Cloud Computing, enhancing my ability to design and implement data-driven solutions. 🚀
